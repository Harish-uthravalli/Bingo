# Housie
Also known as Tambola (in hindi) is a popular version of Bingo and Housie which is played widely across globe. The caller reads out the numbers that are randomly drawn to the audience. The players cross the number off their ticket if they have it after each number is called out. If you think that you have a winning point, announce it quickly to make sure that you can claim the prize!
To all Housie lovers who are getting bored during the Quarantine and want to enjoy a good family time.

HOW TO USE:  
Once you've downloaded Play.py 

1. Install Libraries:
   - pip install gTTs 
   - pip install playsound 
   - pip install keyboard
   
2. To Execute: 
   - python Play.py using a commond prompt or an Editor with terminal.

3. How to Play
   -To Produce a number Press 'n' on your Keyboard 
   -To See all the numbers that were produced press 'n'
   - To Quit press 'q'
   
How I made this:
Using the random library I produce a random numbers list that ranges between 1-99 (including 1 and 99).
gTTs is the library that converts a string to an audio File.
Playsound is used to play that audio file. 

Whenever the key 'n' is pressed on the keyboard a randon number from the random numbers list is printed and converted to speech and that number is removed from that list. 
You can press 'p' to print all the numbers that you can tally to check a winning combination (ex. corners, middle line etc). 

Enjoy :D.
